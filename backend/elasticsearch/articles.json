Only a few years ago, such wrenching deaths would have prompted earnest appeals for a renewed debate over America's porous gun laws. Now after the legislative failure following Sandy Hook, no one from Barack Obama on down has any inclination to embark on another quixotic crusade against gun violence.", "On the surface it seems puzzling that American attitudes are becoming decidedly more liberal on a variety of fronts (including the legalization of marijuana), but support for gun measures has eroded over the past decade. According to the Gallup Poll, 60 percent of Americans in 2004 believed that gun laws should be made \"more strict.\" In October 2014, the \"more strict\" camp had dropped to 47 percent. Other national surveys show a similar downward trajectory.", "So why can the Confederate flag come down, but gun control is stuck in reverse?", "It is simplistic to attribute this entirely to the political clout of the National Rifle Association. With the rise of Super PACs, the NRA's campaign contributions -- while still influential -- are rarely decisive. Yes, the NRA intimidates legislators with its unrelenting stance and lobbying muscle. But not too long ago, foes of gay marriage (remember the Defense of Marriage Act) and good old boys with the Confederate flag on their pickup trucks also scared many in politics.", "So what is it about guns that makes the issue impervious to social change? Why can positions change overnight on the Confederate flag and in a few years on gay marriage, but not over decades about regulating firearms?", "The Confederate Flag Is Linked to Racism", "Not until the segregationist resistance in 1962 was the Confederate battle flag placed atop the South Carolina statehouse. (It was moved to its current position on the statehouse grounds as part of a compromise in 2000). Throw in the obvious historical connection to slavery -- and it grew increasingly difficult for anyone to argue that the flag only commemorates the bravery of the Confederate soldiers.", "In contrast, gun violence kills blacks and whites, gays and straights, with a sad lack of distinction. Moreover, NRA supporters believe (however hyperbolically) that any regulation means that something tangible will be taken from them (their guns). Devotees of the Confederate flag know that they are merely losing a symbol. And foes of gay marriage are sacrificing nothing other than being confronted with the happiness of others.", "In 2015, anything that even hints at intolerance has become bad for business. By coming out promptly for the removal of the flag, South Carolina's governor understood that any effort to retain it would prompt threats of business boycotts and a loss of tourist dollars. As soon as Haley made her announcement, Boeing and Michelin (two companies with major South Carolina plants) issued statements hailing the governor's move.", "In the days that followed, companies like Walmart announced that they would no longer sell merchandise emblazoned with Confederate flags. Praiseworthy, but made-in-China caps and decals were not a major profit center. While Walmart does not sell handguns, hunting rifles and supplies are a significant part of its sporting goods business. As CEO Douglas McMillon told CNN, \"Our focus as it relates to firearms should be hunters...We believe in serving those customers, we have for a long time, and we believe we should continue to.\"", "The Flag Issue Comes with a Permanent Solution", "With Thursday morning's vote, the symbolic battle over the Confederate flag is over in South Carolina and in much of the South. In late June, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley -- who had the power to act unilaterally -- ordered that four Confederate flags be removed from a Civil War memorial at the state capitol.", "In contrast, there is no way that any piece of legislation could prevent most gun deaths in America. With an estimated 300 million guns in circulation and the constraints imposed by the Second Amendment, there are limits on how much passage of background check legislation or reinstituting the assault weapons ban could accomplish.", "Make no mistake: The drive for gun-control legislation is laudable. But one of the why-bother obstacles the cause faces is that success in Congress would only mean a partial victory.", "Guns Are Connected to Fear of Crime", "Last October, Gallup asked a national sample a different type of firearms question: \"Do you think having a gun in the house makes it a safer place?\" Most studies suggest that the answer is \"no.\" But what matters in the gun debate are perceptions and personal psychology. Gallup found that 63 percent of Americans believe that safety is found by having a lethal firearm close at hand.", "What is puzzling is why there has been a dramatic change in the response to this question over the past decade. In 2004, only 42 percent of those surveyed said that owning a gun made them feel safer. What these poll numbers suggest is that Americans have grown more fearful at a time when the violent crime rate has been in sharp decline.", "Part of the explanation may be the potency of pro-gun advocacy by the NRA and similar groups. In 2004, 54 percent of Republicans equated guns with safety. But in 2014 -- after several high-decibel fights over gun control -- that number jumped to 81 percent. Partisanship, though, explains only part of the shift, since 41 percent of Democrats also think that having a gun at home fosters safety.", "Gun control advocates have tried to rebrand the cause as gun safety. But that seems like a ham-handed public relations move when most Americans equate gun safety with having a handgun in a night table drawer.", "Many Americans Misunderstand the Second Amendment", "There is a common misconception -- partly fostered by the NRA and its allies -- that the Second Amendment bars all legislation regulating gun ownership. The Associated Press has been repeatedly asking a question since 2009: \"Do you think that laws limiting gun ownership infringe on the public's right to bear arms under the Second Amendment?\"", "The answers have been consistent -- about half of all Americans believe that the Second Amendment is absolute. In similar fashion, an April 2013 Fox News Poll found that 53 percent of voters feel that \"protecting the constitutional right of citizens to own guns\" is more important than lessening \"gun violence.\"", "The Second Amendment makes the quest for gun legislation different than almost every other cause. Not only do gun-control advocates have to advocate only limited remedies like background checks, but they must also battle against the armchair constitutional theories of Second Amendment absolutists.", "A major reason why the Confederate flag is coming down in South Carolina is because the state's political leadership took control of the issue before out-of-state pressure turned it into an us-versus-them fight.", "But since the law-and-order 1970s, the gun issue has become a proxy in a much larger culture war between urban liberals and those conservatives who see their way of life threatened by change. Barack Obama reflected this divide when he was recorded at off-the-record fund-raiser in 2008 saying about residents of dying industrial towns, \"They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion...as a way to explain their frustrations.\"", "This level of candor was impolitic in 2008 and would be equally toxic today. But it reflects an attitude (which I personally share) of total incomprehension over the passionate attachment of many Americans to their guns. This chasm of perception cannot be bridged by liberal politicians proposing gun measures by saying, \"There is no greater supporter of the Second Amendment than I am, but...\"", "It is anguishing to witness the carnage from gun violence but to be powerless to do anything to limit it. But amid this frustration, proponents of gun control need to rethink the arguments and the emotion that have surrounded this cause in recent decades. For cultural reasons (and not just because of the power and megaphone of the NRA) the message is simply not getting through.", "One tiny sprout of hope remains: Social change can happen with blinding speed in 21st century America.

Gallup found that 63 percent of Americans believe that safety is found by having a lethal firearm close at hand.", "What is puzzling is why there has been a dramatic change in the response to this question over the past decade. In 2004, only 42 percent of those surveyed said that owning a gun made them feel safer. What these poll numbers suggest is that Americans have grown more fearful at a time when the violent crime rate has been in sharp decline.", "Part of the explanation may be the potency of pro-gun advocacy by the NRA and similar groups. In 2004, 54 percent of Republicans equated guns with safety. But in 2014 -- after several high-decibel fights over gun control -- that number jumped to 81 percent. Partisanship, though, explains only part of the shift, since 41 percent of Democrats also think that having a gun at home fosters safety.", "Gun control advocates have tried to rebrand the cause as gun safety. But that seems like a ham-handed public relations move when most Americans equate gun safety with having a handgun in a night table drawer.", "Many Americans Misunderstand the Second Amendment", "There is a common misconception -- partly fostered by the NRA and its allies -- that the Second Amendment bars all legislation regulating gun ownership. The Associated Press has been repeatedly asking a question since 2009: \"Do you think that laws limiting gun ownership infringe on the public's right to bear arms under the Second Amendment?\"", "The answers have been consistent -- about half of all Americans believe that the Second Amendment is absolute. In similar fashion, an April 2013 Fox News Poll found that 53 percent of voters feel that \"protecting the constitutional right of citizens to own guns\" is more important than lessening \"gun violence.\"", "The Second Amendment makes the quest for gun legislation different than almost every other cause. Not only do gun-control advocates have to advocate only limited remedies like background checks, but they must also battle against the armchair constitutional theories of Second Amendment absolutists.", "A major reason why the Confederate flag is coming down in South Carolina is because the state's political leadership took control of the issue before out-of-state pressure turned it into an us-versus-them fight.", "But since the law-and-order 1970s, the gun issue has become a proxy in a much larger culture war between urban liberals and those conservatives who see their way of life threatened by change. Barack Obama reflected this divide when he was recorded at off-the-record fund-raiser in 2008 saying about residents of dying industrial towns, \"They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion...as a way to explain their frustrations.\"", "This level of candor was impolitic in 2008 and would be equally toxic today. But it reflects an attitude (which I personally share) of total incomprehension over the passionate attachment of many Americans to their guns. This chasm of perception cannot be bridged by liberal politicians proposing gun measures by saying, \"There is no greater supporter of the Second Amendment than I am, but...\"", "It is anguishing to witness the carnage from gun violence but to be powerless to do anything to limit it. But amid this frustration, proponents of gun control need to rethink the arguments and the emotion that have surrounded this cause in recent decades.

The event not only sparked emotions, but also a debate about whether the banner's removal would have an effect on race relations in America.Yaki Hillery says he knew it would happen someday.\"Some things are truly designed to expire,\" he says. \"This is a situation where it has expired.\"Friday morning the Hyde Park barber, along with some of his clients, witnessed American history as the Confederate Flag was removed from South Carolina's statehouse where it flew for 54 years.The rebel flag's demise comes after it was featured in an online, racist manifesto by alleged shooter Dylann Roof which emerged following the massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in June.\"I don't think it will change anything,\" says Maurice Stoball. \"I really don't think it will change a lot between blacks and whites.\"Other Chicagoans watched the flag come down while eating breakfast at the iconic Valois Restaurant.\"I think the Confederate flag doesn't symbolize what it means to be united as one people,\" said Tammy Stelnicki.\"It definitely makes everyone more comfortable coming to the U.S.,\" said Thomas Morales.Retiree Mary Ward, a native of Mississippi, says the brief ceremony was emotional and moving.\"I was taught if you see that flag displayed, it's a bewarement being an African American or black person,\" she said.Historians say that while the Confederate flag started as a symbol of the unified southern states' secession, it has come to represent inequality and discrimination.\"Historically, it does represent a society that totally embraced the idea that African Americans were not equal,\" says Russell Lewis of the Chicago History Museum.Flag supporters continue to rally around their banner. The Sons of Confederate Veterans Camp Douglas 516, located in Chicago, shared a post on their Facebook page calling the flag's removal \"...a politically convenient insult to the legacy of millions of South Carolinians.\"The post's author also vows that, \"...as this particular flag comes down, thousands more are being lifted, for the St. Andrews Cross stands not for hate, but for love.\"While many try to absorb the significance of the flag's removal in South Carolina, resistance to other confederate symbols is growing. The Virginia division of Sons of Confederate Veterans is preparing to go to court over their specialty license plates, where has their flag-themed banner displayed prominently.For the first time since the civil rights movement, the Confederate flag was removed entirely from the South Carolina Statehouse, in a swift ceremony Friday before thousands of people who cheered as the Civil War-era banner was lowered from a 30-foot flagpole.Many people believed the flag would fly indefinitely in this state, which was the first to leave Union, but the killing of nine black church members during a Bible study in Charleston last month changed that sentiment and reignited calls to bring down Confederate flags and symbols across the nation.The crowd, estimated at up to 10,000 people, chanted \"USA, USA\" and \"hey, hey, hey, goodbye\" as an honor guard of South Carolina troopers lowered the flag during a 6-minute ceremony. Gov. Nikki Haley stood on the Statehouse steps along with family members of the victims and other dignitaries. While she didn't speak, she nodded and smiled in the direction of the crowd after someone shouted: \"Thank you governor.\"Haley supported the flag before the shooting, but the Republican had a change of heart in the days after the killings and led the push to get legislators to pass a bill before the end of the summer. She signed the legislation Thursday.As she looked on, two white troopers rolled up the flag neatly and tied it with a white ribbon. They handed it to a black trooper who brought it to the Statehouse steps.Highway Patrol Cpl. Rupert Pope downplayed the significance of their race in the ceremony.\"We're all gray,\" he said, with the other officers nodding in agreement.President Barack Obama tweeted minutes after the flag was down, saying it was \"a sign of good will and healing and a meaningful step towards a better future.\" Obama delivered a eulogy at the funeral for state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, who was also pastor of the church where the killings took place.The honor guard was the same group of men who carried Pinckney's coffin into the Statehouse for a viewing last month.A van brought the flag to the nearby Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum. There, it eventually will be housed in a multimillion-dollar shrine lawmakers promised to build as part of a deal to get a bill passed removing the flag.South Carolina's leaders first flew the battle flag over the Statehouse dome in 1961 to mark the 100th anniversary of the Civil War.

(AP) \u2014 South Carolina pulled the Confederate flag from its place of honor at the Statehouse on Friday, marking a milestone in how America commemorates the war that tore the United States apart 150 years ago. Many people believed the rebel banner would fly forever in the first state to leave the Union, despite bitter feelings that remained after the flag was demoted from atop the Capitol dome to a Confederate monument out front 15 years ago. But the killings of nine black church members during a Bible study in Charleston last month suddenly changed the political truths and consequences surrounding Civil War symbols. The battle flag unfurled to assert white power and protest the civil rights protest in the 1960s had been defended by white Republican leaders until last month as a symbol of Southern pride. After the church attack, even supporters felt compelled to acknowledge that the flag also represents racial hatred. \"No lie can live forever. That flag is a lie,\" South Carolina NAACP President Lonnie Randolph said. The flag came down Friday without incident, in a 6-minute ceremony, amid a crowd of up to 10,000 people chanting \"USA, USA,\" and \"hey, hey, hey, goodbye.\" A multi-racial honor guard of South Carolina troopers wearing dress-gray uniforms and white gloves carefully folded and rolled it up. The flag was then taken to the state's Confederate Relic Room to be put in a new multimillion-dollar display. Later Friday, the 30-foot pole it flew on was yanked out after several mighty tugs from a crane. Overseeing it all was an imposing statue of Benjamin Tillman, the South Carolina governor who went to Washington as a U.S. senator and proudly described how he undermined post-Civil War Reconstruction by killing black people who tried to vote in the 1800s. Gov. Nikki Haley, who has national ambitions of her own, felt compelled by last month's killings to call for bringing down the flag, only months after calling her Democratic opponent's demand to do the same thing a \"stunt.\" Other leading Republicans swiftly reversed their positions as well, and Thursday's final votes in South Carolina's Republican-led legislature were overwhelmingly in favor of removal. As the flag came down, Haley joined family members of the victims and other dignitaries on the steps of the Statehouse, and while she didn't speak, she nodded and smiled after someone in the crowd shouted: \"Thank you governor.\" President Barack Obama tweeted minutes later, calling it \"a sign of good will and healing and a meaningful step towards a better future.\" The leader of the South Carolina chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans refused to attend, instead recalling his seven ancestors who fought for the South in the Civil War. \"I'm not going down there to watch them be dishonored and defamed,\" Leland Summers said. But if South Carolina couldn't make a last stand for the Lost Cause, where else might it happen? From Alabama to Alaska, Confederate and segregationist monuments, statues, symbols and place names are being re-examined. \"They aren't going to be happy until Mississippi is just like Michigan,\" said Nelson Waller, who joined several dozen flag supporters in a rally at the Statehouse earlier this week, but said he was too heartbroken to see it taken down. Two white troopers neatly tied the rolled-up flag with a white ribbon, then handed it to a black trooper who marched it away. But Highway Patrol Cpl. Rupert Pope downplayed the significance of their race. \"We're all gray,\" Pope said. \"All gray, yes sir,\" repeated the black officer, Derrick Gamble. The same seven-man honor guard carried state Sen. Clementa Pinckney's coffin into the Statehouse for a viewing last month. Pinckney also led the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, where he and eight others were gunned down during their Bible study. Police arrested a white gunman who had posed with Confederate flags, and called it a hate crime. Family members of the slain churchgoers were given prime spots to watch the flag's removal, joined by a crowd of between 8,000 and 10,000 people, according to Sherri Iacobelli of the state Department of Public Safety. Denise Quarles, who lost her mother, Myra Thompson, said \"the Emanuel 9\" were surely smiling down from heaven. \"The tragedy was a tragedy. But now on the other side of that tragedy, we see a lot of positives coming out. Maybe people will change their hearts,\" Quarles said. Lawmakers in other states are targeting other symbols. The Mississippi flag includes the rebel battle flag, and Georgia's incorporates another Confederate design. Thousands of Southerners drive cars with license plates featuring the rebel banner, which was quickly banished from Alabama's capitol and federal cemeteries since the shootings. In Memphis, Tennessee, officials are working to remove the remains and a statue of slave trader, Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest from a prominent city park. The South Carolina NAACP is not calling for the removal of monuments, but it does want them to tell larger truths. For example, Randolph said, the Tillman statue should also note that he was responsible for a mob that killed six blacks in 1876 and put their bodies on display as a warning against trying to vote. \"South Carolina has an unfortunate distinction of breeding bad people. I'm not going to criticize any of them, but you know who they are. All you have to do is go outside and look at the monuments,\" Randolph said. South Carolina's leaders first raised the battle flag over the Statehouse dome in 1961 to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the Civil War, then kept it there as blacks asserted voting rights and demanded an end to racially discriminatory laws. More recent legislative battles over claims that blacks are being disenfranchised have taken place under its shadow. \"It feels so good to be out here and be happy about it,\" said Ronald D. Barton, a 52-year-old pastor who recalled being filled with anger during the 2000 ceremony that moved the flag from the dome to the pole. That year, a much larger crowd screamed and yelled at flag supporters, as Civil War re-enactors raised the banner again. __ Follow Jeffrey Collins at https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP and Meg Kinnard at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .", "img_src": "http://binaryapi.ap.org/9ae64472cde540b98a929872c19f5391/460x.jpg", "paragraphs": ["COLUMBIA, S.C.

It was flown by Southern armies during the Civil War as they fought to keep slavery. And it was later brought back in the 1960s, as Vox's Libby Nelson explained, to intimidate civil rights advocates and defend segregation.", "Supporters of the Confederate flag claim it's flown to honor the dead who fought in the Civil War and pay tribute to the South's heritage. The problem is this heritage is mired in racism \u2014 as demonstrated by states' justifications for seceding at the start of the Civil War.", "South Carolina, the first state to secede, said in its official statement that it saw any attempts to abolish slavery and grant rights to black Americans as \"hostile to the South\" and \"destructive of its beliefs and safety\":", "A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery. He is to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has declared that that \"Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,\" and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate extinction. This sectional combination for the submersion of the Constitution, has been aided in some of the States by elevating to citizenship, persons who, by the supreme law of the land, are incapable of becoming citizens; and their votes have been used to inaugurate a new policy, hostile to the South, and destructive of its beliefs and safety.", "Mississippi, meanwhile, was even more explicit in its statement, saying that its \"position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery\":", "Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery \u2014 the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin. That we do not overstate the dangers to our institution, a reference to a few facts will sufficiently prove.", "These statements leave no doubt that the South fought in the Civil War to protect the institution of slavery. This deeply racist history is why South Carolina lawmakers were criticized for allowing the flag to fly over the state Capitol \u2014 and why they decided to take it down."]}, {"url": "http://dlvr.it/BTfQkL", "description": "SC Makes History by Taking Down Confederate Flag", "img_src": null, "paragraphs": []}]
